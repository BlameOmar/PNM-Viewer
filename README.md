# PNM-Viewer #

A simple image viewer for Netpbm format files.

I wrote this because the OS doesn't natively support these files and third party programs (including Photoshop)
don't display these properly.


## Supported File Formats ##

  1. .pbm (Binary)
  2. .pgm (Binary)
  3. .ppm (Binary)
  4. Any of the above with the .pnm file extension

  
### Future ###

  5. ASCII versions of the above
  6. .pam
