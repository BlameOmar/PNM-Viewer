# PNM-Viewer #

A simple image viewer for Netpbm format files for OS X.

I wrote this because the OS doesn't natively support these files and third party programs (including Photoshop)
don't display these properly.


## Supported File Formats ##

  - .pbm (Binary)
  - .pgm (Binary)
  - .ppm (Binary)
  - Any of the above with the .pnm file extension

  
### Future ###

  - ASCII versions of the above
  - .pam
